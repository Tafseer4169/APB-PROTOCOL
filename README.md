# 🚌 APB Slave Verification using SystemVerilog (Non-UVM)

The **APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) Slave Verification Environment** is a **SystemVerilog class-based, Non-UVM verification project** developed to verify the functionality of an APB slave RTL. The verification environment employs **constrained-random stimulus**, **mailbox-based communication**, **self-checking scoreboards**, and **functional coverage** to validate read, write, and error scenarios in accordance with the AMBA APB protocol.

## 🧠 Key Features

### 🏗️ Class-Based Verification Environment

* Built using **SystemVerilog Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.
* Modular verification components without using UVM.
* Easy to understand and extend for beginners.

### 🎲 Constrained Random Verification

* Randomized APB transactions.
* Configurable address and data constraints.
* Automatic generation of read and write operations.

### 📬 Mailbox-Based Communication

* Generator → Driver communication through mailbox.
* Monitor → Scoreboard communication through mailbox.
* Event-based synchronization between verification components.

### ✅ Self-Checking Scoreboard

* Maintains a reference memory model.
* Automatically compares DUT responses with expected results.
* Reports data mismatches and APB slave errors.

### 📊 Functional Coverage

* Address Coverage
* Read/Write Coverage
* Data Coverage
* PSLVERR Coverage
* Cross Coverage (Address × Read/Write)
* Cross Coverage (Error × Read/Write)
